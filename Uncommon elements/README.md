You are given two lists of different lengths of positive integers. Write an algorithm to count the number of elements that are not common to each list.

#### Input

The first line of the input consists of an integer array separated by spaces representing the first list of positive integers.

The second line of the input consists of an integer array separated by spaces representing the second list of positive integers.

#### Output

Print a positive integer representing the count of elements that are ```not common``` to both the lists of integers.

```
Example:

Input:
1 1 2 3 4 5 5 7 6 9 10
11 12 13 4 5 6 7 18 19 20

Output:
12

Explanation:
The numbers that are not common to both lists are [1,1,2,3,9,10,11,12,13,18,19,20]
So, the output is 12
