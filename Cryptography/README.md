The use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago and today we will create a algorithm to decrypt some encrypted messages.

You have a mapping of alphabets with a nu,ber

```
a - 1
b - 2
c - 3
.
.
.
z - 26
```

You will have a encrypted message, your task is to find the total number of ways that message can be decrypted.

Input

```
You will have a string S
```

Output

```
You have to return the total number of ways that string can be encrypted
```

#### Example

```
Input:
111
Output: 
3

Explanation:
111 can be decoded into 'aaa','ka','ak'
```
