Write a program to check whether year 2100 is a leap year or not. Print 1 if it a Leap Year and 0 if it not a Leap Year.

Definition of Leap Year:

```
One year has the length of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds.
This is hard to calculate with, so a normal year has been given 365 days
and a leap year 366 days. In leap years, February 29th is added as leap day, 
which doesn't exist in a normal year. A leap year is every 4 years, but not every
100 years, then again every 400 years.
