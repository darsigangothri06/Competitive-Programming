Given a keypad of a mobile and keys that need to be pressed, the task is to print the COUNT of all word combinations which are possible to generate for input "96"

```
{1}   {2}   {3}
[ABC] [DEF] [GHI]
{4}   {5}   {6}
[JKL] [MNO] [PQR]
{7}   {8}   {9}
[STU] [VWX] [YZ]
```

Example if Input is 12

```
Combinations are [AD, BD, CD, AE, BE, CE, AF, BF, CF]
so Output should be 9
```

Example if Input is 4

```
Combinations are [J, K, L] Output should be 3
```
