The GCD which is also known as HCF, of N numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all the numbers without leaving a remainder.

Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers.

#### Input

The first line of the input consists of an integer ```num```, representing the number of positive integers (N).

The second line consists of N space-separated integers arr1, arr2, ... arr N-1 

representing a list of positive integers.

#### Output

Print an integer representing the GCD of the given postive integers.

#### Example

```
Input:
5
2 4 6 8 10

Output:
2

Explanation:
The largest positive integer that divides all the positive integers 2 4 6 8 10 without leaving a remainder is 2
So, the output is 2
